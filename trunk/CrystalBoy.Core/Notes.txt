CIL/MSIL allows memory copies / initializations directly via two opcodes: cpblk and initblk.
Since these are not directly accessible in C#, two DynamicMethod using these opcodes are built at runtime.
All the core functions can be built without interop if needed, they'll just rely on CLR functionality instead. (useful for non Win32 environments)
